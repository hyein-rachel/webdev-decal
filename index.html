    <h1>Ariel (The Little Mermaid)</h1>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariel_(The_Little_Mermaid)" target="_blank">The Actual Wiki</a>

    <p>Ariel is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' 28th animated film The Little Mermaid (1989). 
        Ariel is voiced by Jodi Benson in all official animated appearances and merchandise. 
        She is fourth in the Disney Princess lineup and the first nonhuman princess.
        Ariel is the seventh-born daughter of King Triton and Queen Athena of an underwater kingdom of merfolk called Atlantica.
        She is often rebellious, and in the first film, she longs to be a part of the human world. 
        She marries Prince Eric, whom she rescued from a shipwreck, and together they have a daughter, Melody.
        The character is based on the title character of Hans Christian Andersen's 1837 fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" 
        but was developed into a different personality for the 1989 animated film adaptation.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>Ariel was based on the title character of Hans Christian Andersen's "The Little Mermaid", 
        but co-director and writer Ron Clements felt that the mermaid in the original story was too tragic and rewrote the character, resulting in Ariel.
        Jodi Benson, who was predominantly a stage actress, was chosen to voice Ariel because the directors felt 
        "it was really important to have the same person doing the singing and speaking voice". 
        Clements stated that Benson's voice had a unique "sweetness" and "youthfulness".
        Ariel's original design was developed by animator Glen Keane.
        A challenge in animating Ariel for the 1989 film was the color required to show Ariel in the changing environments, 
        both under the sea and on land, for which the animators required thirty-two color models, not including costume changes. 
        The sea-green color of Ariel's mermaid tail was a hue specially mixed by the Disney paint lab; the color was named "Ariel" after the character. 
        The choice of red as Ariel's hair color was the subject of dispute between the filmmakers and studio executives who wanted the character to have blonde hair. 
        It was noted that red hair contrasted better with Ariel's green tail, red was easier to darken than yellow, and Disney's live-action branch Touchstone Pictures had recently released Splash that had a blonde mermaid; 
        Ariel's red hair was ultimately kept.

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Ariel is the youngest of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters.
        She is often seen in the company of Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned to keep an eye on her. 
        In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto.
        Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. 
        In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human.
        Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment.
        She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.
        Ariel is kind and caring to others no matter what their circumstances, as depicted in the television series. 
        In an early episode, Ariel helps an orphaned merboy who had fallen in with a bad crowd.
        In another episode, Ariel befriends a supposed bad luck creature and protects it from Ursula and other merfolk who wish it harm.
        Ariel appears as an adult in Return to the Sea and gives birth to a daughter named Melody, becoming the first, and currently, only, Disney princess to become a mother. 
        Ariel is protective of her daughter, as Triton was of Ariel in the first film. 
        After Morgana threatens Ariel and King Triton, Prince Eric and Ariel build a wall around the palace to protect Melody from Morgana and other terrors of the ocean. 
        Although it protected her, it could not protect her curiosity.
        Ariel's Beginning depicts her personality as it was in the original film after Jodi Benson had advocated returning the character to her roots.
        Ariel is once again rebellious, and after her father decrees music to be banned in Atlantica she runs away with Sebastian and his band.
